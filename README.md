# Welcome to Samalytics

## Who am I?

I graduated from South Dakota State University in 2019 with degress in Data Science & Mathematics, with minors in Computer Science, Statistics, and Applied Statistics. Prior to venturing into the world of data, I interned as a software developer with both IBM and Protolabs.
